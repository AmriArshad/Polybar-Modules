# athan-module
A simple script that checks the time until the next Islamic prayer by making use of the [AlAdhan's Prayer Times API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api).


### Setting up the module in [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar):
Copy athan.py into your scripts folder.  
This can be found at ~/.config/polybar/scripts/

Inside athan.py, change the CITY, COUNTRY and SCHOOL variables to match your location and prayer time calculation method accordingly. 

Finally place this config in the modules section of your polybar config and change formatting as desired.

```
[module/athan]
type = custom/script
interval = 30
format = <label>
format-prefix = "ï™« "
format-prefix-foreground = ${colors.secondary}
format-underline = ${colors.secondary}
format-foreground = ${colors.foreground}
format-background = ${colors.background}
exec = python -u ~/.config/polybar/scripts/athan.py
tail = true
```
