# Crypto Fear & Greed Index
A simple script which pulls the current crypto fear & greed index from alternative.me's [api](https://api.alternative.me/fng/)

### Setting up the module in [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar):
Copy fgindex.py into your scripts folder.

```
[module/fgindex]

format-prefix = "î‚˜ "
format-prefix-foreground = ${colors.secondary}
format-underline = ${colors.secondary}
format-foreground = ${colors.foreground}

exec = python -u ~/.config/polybar/scripts/fgindex.py
